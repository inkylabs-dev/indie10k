# PRD: Indie10K Project Missions

## 1. Overview

**Indie10K Missions** is a **project-specific roadmap system**.  
Each project has its own mission plan, starting with a **30-day kickoff** generated by AI from user input. The mission list is **dynamic**: reviewed weekly by AI (and adjusted if the user has coach discussions).

This makes missions **serious, personalized, and adaptive** — a real startup “coach” embedded inside each project.

----------

## 2. Goals & Objectives

-   **Primary Goal:** Provide founders with a structured, evolving roadmap for their specific project.
    
-   **Secondary Goals:**
    
    -   Replace vague “what should I do?” with concrete, sequential tasks.
        
    -   Ensure missions adapt to new learnings and discussions with a coach.
        
    -   Create accountability and a history of execution for each project.

## 3. User Stories

1.  As a **new user**, I want to set up a project by answering onboarding questions (idea, target audience, revenue model, current progress).
    
2.  As a **founder**, I want Indie10K AI to generate a 30-day action plan tailored to my project.
    
3.  As a **busy builder**, I want to see a daily/weekly mission dashboard, so I know what to focus on.
    
4.  As a **learner**, I want missions to adapt weekly based on progress, failures, or coach discussions.
    
5.  As a **professional**, I want to keep mission logs inside each project for later review.

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

-   **Risk:** AI generates irrelevant tasks. → **Mitigation:** users can delete/regenerate missions anytime.
    
-   **Risk:** Users skip weekly reviews. → **Mitigation:** gentle reminders + optional quick 1-click reflection.
    
-   **Risk:** Dependence on vague coach notes. → **Mitigation:** structured coach input fields (focus, challenge, feedback).
