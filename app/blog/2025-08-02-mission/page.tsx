            At Indie10k, we believe every independent developer deserves a clear, achievable path to financial freedom.
          </p>

          <p>
            Too many projects die not because of bad ideas, but because of a lack of structure, momentum, and the right
            tools. Weâ€™re here to change that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, Indie10k is a roadmap and trackerâ€”helping you go from $0 to your first $1000 with daily tasks,
            revenue tracking, and growth insights.
          </p>

          <p>Tomorrow, Indie10k will be your automated co-pilot:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>A personal coach that adapts tasks to your goals.</li>
            <li>A dashboard that connects traffic, revenue, and progress.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Our long-term vision is to turn Indie10k into the complete income-assistant for indie makersâ€”from idea â†’
            execution â†’ traffic â†’ revenue â†’ $10k and beyond.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because indie developers donâ€™t just need another to-do app. They need a partner that helps them finish,
            launch, and win. ðŸš€
